    """Computes the average of a stream of values.

    Forward accepts

        - ``weight`` (float tensor): ``(...)``

    Args:
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and returns None if this is
            set to False. default: True
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step.
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
            default: None (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state.
            When `None`, DDP will be used to perform the allgather.

        >>> avg.update(3)
        >>> avg.update(1)
